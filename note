2. Determine Wall Direction in render_vision_ray
After calling choose_ray_tip(), you need to figure out which wall face was hit. Add logic like:
Check if horizontal or vertical wall hit:

Compare h_dist vs v_dist (you already do this in choose_ray_tip)
Store which type was chosen (horizontal or vertical)

Determine compass direction:
For horizontal walls:

If ray angle is 0° to 180° (pointing down): You hit a NORTH face
If ray angle is 180° to 360° (pointing up): You hit a SOUTH face

For vertical walls:

If cos(ray_angle) > 0 (pointing right): You hit a WEST face
If cos(ray_angle) < 0 (pointing left): You hit an EAST face


formula: radian * 180 / PI
