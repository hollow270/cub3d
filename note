texture_x = (int)(tip_p->x) % 64
```

For **vertical walls**:
```
texture_x = (int)(tip_p->y) % 64
```

The modulo gives you 0-63, which maps to the texture column.

### 4. Modify `draw_stripe` to Sample Textures

Currently your `draw_stripe` draws solid white. You need to change it to:

For each Y pixel in the wall stripe:
- Calculate how far down the wall you are (0.0 at top to 1.0 at bottom)
- Convert this to texture Y coordinate (0 to 63)
- Get the color from `texture_data[texture_y * 64 + texture_x]`
- Draw that color instead of white

**The calculation:**
```
For Y from wall_start_y to wall_end_y:
    progress = (Y - wall_start_y) / wall_height
    texture_y = (int)(progress * 63)
    
    // Clamp texture_y
    if texture_y < 0: texture_y = 0
    if texture_y > 63: texture_y = 63
    
    // Get color from appropriate texture
    color = texture_data[texture_y * 64 + texture_x]
    
    // Draw PX_SIZE wide stripe with this color
    mlx_pixel_put(..., color)
```

## Data Structure Additions Needed

You'll need to add to your structs:

**In game struct:**
- 4 texture image pointers (void*)
- 4 texture data arrays (int*)
- Texture width/height (probably both 64)

**In raycast struct (or pass as parameters):**
- Which wall direction was hit
- The texture X coordinate

## High-Level Flow
```
1. At init:
   - Load north_texture.xpm → get north_data array
   - Load south_texture.xpm → get south_data array
   - Load east_texture.xpm → get east_data array
   - Load west_texture.xpm → get west_data array

2. For each ray in render_vision_ray:
   - Cast ray (you already do this)
   - Determine wall direction (add this)
   - Calculate texture_x (add this)
   - Pass wall_direction and texture_x to draw_stripe
   
3. In draw_stripe:
   - Select appropriate texture based on wall_direction
   - For each Y pixel:
     * Calculate texture_y
     * Get color from texture[texture_y * 64 + texture_x]
     * Draw that color
```

## Important Notes

**Performance Warning:** Using `mlx_pixel_put` for every pixel will be VERY slow. For textures, you're drawing thousands of pixels per frame. Consider switching back to the image buffer method for better performance.

**Texture Access:** The texture data array works exactly like your screen buffer:
```
color = texture_data[y * width + x]
