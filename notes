		> use get_next_line to get each line from the file and output everything
		into a char **map while skipping lines that have nothing
		> make a function that turns char **map into a linked list, the catch is
		to add simple nodes that contain text like "TEXTURE BEGIN" or "MAP BEGIN"
		to mark the start of sections to make parsing and error handling easier
